# # GHZ State Preparation with Parallelism
# In this example, we will implement a *Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger* (GHZ) state preparation circuit with $N = 2^n$ qubits.
#
# First, we will present the standard linear-depth construction in Bloqade but later we will present a log-depth
# construction that achieves the same result. We then take this one step further and use the fact that Bloqade
# (and QuEra's neutral atom hardware!) support *parallel* gates, allowing for the application of the same gate
# across multiple qubits simultaneously. Combined with the fact that atom *shuttling* allows for arbitrary
# connectivity, we can also decrease the circuit execution depth from $N + 1$ to just $n$.

# ## Simple Linear Depth Implementation of a GHZ State Preparation Circuit
#
# A simple GHZ state preparation circuit can be built with $N$ CX gates and $1$ H gate.
# This gives the circuit an execution depth of $N+1$.

# ## Log-depth Implementation of a GHZ State Preparation Circuit
#
# Let's take a look how we can rewrite the circuit to take advantage of QuEra's hardware capabilities.
# We can achieve log(N) circuit depth by [rearranging the CX gates (see *Mooney, White, Hill, Hollenberg* - 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08946).
#
# Before going any further, it's worth distinguishing between the concept of **circuit depth** and **circuit execution depth**.
# For example, in the following implementation, each CX gate instruction inside the for-loop is executed in sequence.
# So even thought the circuit depth is $N/2 + 1$, the circuit execution depth is still $N + 1$.

# ## Our Native Gate Set and Parallelism
# By nature, our digital quantum computer can execute native gates in parallel in an single instruction/ execution cycle.
# The concept is very similar to the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) in classical computing.
#
# On our hardware, there are two important factors to be considered:
# 1. the native gate set allows for arbitrary (parallel) rotations and (parallel) CZ gates.
# 2. Our atom shuttling architecture allows arbitrary qubit connectivity. This means that our parallel instruction is not limited to fixed connectivity (for example nearest neighbor connectivity).
#
# With this in mind, we can rewrite the `layer` subroutine to now use the `qasm2.parallel` dialect in Bloqade.
# We know that the CX gate can be decomposed into a CZ gate with two single-qubit gates $R_y(-\pi/2)$ and $R_y(\pi/2)$ acting on the target qubits.
# With this decomposition in mind, we can now using our parallel gate instructions `parallel.u` and `parallel.cz`.
# With the following modification, we can further reduce the circuit execution depth to just $n$ (log of the total number of qubits $N$)

# A Note on using closures to capture global variables:
# Since Bloqade's `qasm2` does not allow a main program with arguments, we need to put the program in a closure.
# Our Kirin compiler toolchain can capture the global variable inside the closure.
# In this case, the `n_qubits` will be captured upon calling the `ghz_log_simd(n_qubits)` python function.
# As a result, the returned `qasm2` program will not have any arguments.
