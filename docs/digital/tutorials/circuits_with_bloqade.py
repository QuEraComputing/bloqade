# # Circuits with Bloqade
# 
# In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to write circuits and quantum executions with Bloqade. Specifically, we will use the `squin` dialect set from the compiler toolchain `kirin`. `SQUIN` stands for `S`tructural `Qu`antum `IN`struction set and is the circuit-level representation of quantum executions. It is built on top of the `kirin` framework, an [open-source compiler toolchain](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/) for embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) that target scientific computing kernels. A key feature of squin is the _kernel_, which can roughly be seen as the object which will be executed on the target hardware. Naturally, this hardware could be a quantum computer but it also extends to classical execution as well, such as mid-circuit feedforward or even non-quantum execution such as robotics.
# 
# These kernels can be built using decorators of python functions. We will use the `@squin.kernel` decorator in this notebook but keep in mind that other eDSLs have different decorators inherited from base Kirin decorators. The decorator lowers Python's abstract syntax tree (AST) into a kirin SSA (single static assignment) form, which is a useful intermediate representation for compiler analysis. You don't have to worry too much about SSA or compilers here, but if you want to learn more check out the [kirin documentation](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/).

# ### Squin kernel statements
# 
# To represent quantum executions, we must write and construct squin kernels. These kernels can use the typical structure of python functions -- inputs, outputs, for loops, control flow, subroutines, and so forth -- as a feature of the underlying base Kirin statements. Because one can intermix control flow with operations and measurement, arbitrary mid-circuit feed forward comes for "free".
# 
# There are four sets of statements which you can use to represent quantum programs:
# 1. `squin.qubit` - Manipulation and declaration of the qubits themselves.
# 2. `squin.gate` - Wrapper functions around operations which execute gates on qubits
# 3. `squin.op` - The wider class of quantum operations on qubits, on which to build custom gates
# 4. `squin.noise` - Representing noise effects on the qubits.
# 
# The first set of expressions are the familiar representations of quantum gates, measurements, and qubits. These are under the `squin.qubit` and `squin.gate` namespaces

# You are also able to define your own custom gates using the `op` dialects. Operators are gates and other quantum operations decoupled from application on particular target qubits. Each `squin.gate` method is actually its own kernel which creates an operation and then applies it to a particular qubit. Separating the definition of operators from their application to qubits enables several convenient analysis techniques, such as identifying equivalent gates with common subexpressions elimination. Note that operators do not necessarily have to be unitary, and can more widely represent objects such as observables and Hamiltonians.

# ## Building circuits in Cirq and other SDKs
# Instead of writing your circuit directly in bloqade, it is also possible to build circuits using Cirq or other SDKs, and then lower them to and from bloqade kernels. This has the advantage of being able to leverage the excellent and in-depth resources of transpilation and circuit optimization without having to reinvent the wheel. However, for certain programs, such as those requiring more complex mid-circuit feed-forward, it is still required to write bloqade kernels as there is no adequate representation in other SDKs.
# 
# Let us begin by writing a simple GHZ state preparation circuit, in analogy to the bloqade kernel above. Observe that the resulting object is a static representation of a circuit, similar to the `GHZ_state` kernel, and differentiated from the dynamic `GHZ_state_factory` kernel which can return a dynamically sized GHZ state.

# ## Simulation, emulation, and analysis
# 
# A kernel is simply a representation of an execution, and is not much use without being able to analyze and execute that kernel. We can simulate the action of kernels using concrete interpreters. The emulator must a) keep track of the classical state of the variables, b) keep track of the quantum state of the qubits, and thus c) faithfully represent the execution of that program as if it was run on a hybrid quantum/classical computer. Bloqade's emulator is built on top of the excellent [PyQrack quantum simulator](https://pyqrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and satisfies the three goals above.
# 
# There are three main objects when considering simulation:
# 1. **The emulator object** - Representing the thing that some kernel is going to be executed on. Today it is the PyQrack simulator, but eventually it could also include other simulators or physical hardware. The `*.task` method builds...
# 2. **The task object** - Binding together the emulator, kernel execution, and input parameters for that kernel. This task is not executed until the `*.run` method is called. Upon calling `run`, the kernel is interpreted, the quantum circuit is executed, any classical co-processing is done, and the kernel completes. Repeated calling of `run` will "reset" the executor into its initial state and rerun the kernel. After running, returns...
# 3. **The results object** - Whatever the `return` of the kernel is is returned here, with the same type signature. These could be qubits or qubit registers (list of qubits), values, or really whatever object you like.
# 
# Each `*.run` call can be considered as a single "measurement shot" on hardware. To average across multiple measurements, one must call `*.run` multiple times, as is done a few cells below.

# %%
from bloqade.pyqrack import StackMemorySimulator, DynamicMemorySimulator
# StackMemorySimulator - static number of qubits
# DynamicMemorySimulator - dynamic number of qubits, but slower. Use if you don't know how many qubits you need in advance.
emulator = StackMemorySimulator(min_qubits=8)

task = emulator.task(GHZ_state_factory, args=(4,))
results = task.run()
# The results is the same ResultType as the kernel return.
# In this case, it is a list of qubits.
print(results)


# %% [markdown]
# Note that, while it is instinctive to simply call `GHZ_state_factory(4)` and expect it to run, this isn't necessarily the correct abstraction. `emulator.task` links the kernel to a specific interpreter-- for example, if you wanted to run your program on a noisy emulator vs a perfect emulator vs. real hardware, this is the way you would specify it. Furthermore, the _instantiation_ of the task is not necessarily linked with the _execution_ of that task. For example, if that task must be run asynchronously on hardware, there must be an object which represents the run itself as well as the (future) results.
# 
# For simpler kernels that only use kirin builtin statements -- such as control flow, for loops, arithmetic, and the like -- it is possible to directly call the kernel and use the default Kirin interpreter.

# ### Quantum states
# 
# PyQRack is mainly intended as an *emulator*, attempting to recreate the physical action and interaction of quantum hardware with classical controls. However, it is often useful for user analysis and debugging to extract out non-physical values, such as the quantum statevector, fidelity, or exact expectation values of observables and correlation functions.
# 
# These nonphysical values are based in being able to directly observe and evaluate the quantum state. The state can be extracted via the `PyQrackSimulator.quantum_state` method, with an input signature of a list of (pyqrack) qubits. These qubits can be generated as a return value from a kernel (as is the case for the `GHZ_state_factory` function) or from the `task.qubits()` method.
# 
# The resulting state is a reduced density matrix represented by its eigensystem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
# The state vector basis is the Z basis
# The edannes of the basis is consistent with cirq, with the basis index representing the binary value: the 0th index representing |00000>, 1st representing |00001>, 5th representing |00101> and so forth, with |00001> representing a flip of the last qubit in the list.
# The RDM form is chosen because the qubit list may be an entangled subset of the entire register, and thus may be a mixed state. The eigensystem form is chosen because if the state is pure -- or only slightly entangled -- the resulting state will be efficiently represented by only carrying the nonzero eigenvectors of the density matrix. Consistent with `np.linalg.eigh`, the first index indexes the eigenvector (e.g. `eigenvector[:,3]` is the 4th eigenvector with eigenvalue `eigenvalue[3]`)

# # Mid-circuit feed forward
# 
# Bloqade kernels are able to natively represent mid-circuit feed-forward using control flow represented by standard pythonic if-else and while structures. While the possibilities are endless, including measurement based quantum computing and error correction, we show two examples here.
# 
# The first is T state teleportation, which teleports a T gate that was applied to an ancilla (a "T state") onto the target state using only Clifford gates and feedforward. Due to the property of being Clifford, the circuit itself is fault tolerant and thus plays an important role in many error corrected algorithms.

# ### Constant depth GHZ state
# 
# Remarkably, it is also possible to prepare a GHZ state with a constant number of gates. At first glance, this seems impossible: quantum information can only propagate as fast as the information lightcone, and so a constant depth circuit can only have a small amount of entanglementâ€”not enough to prepare the long-range correlated GHZ state. The trick is, we can replace quantum gates with ancillas and classical feedforward measurements so that the information is propagated classically instead of quantumly. For more details, check out [1] and [2].

# 
# The explicit circuit for the GHZ circuit is shown in Fig. 5 of [1]. There is classical feedforward in the form of a parity check, which requires a classical XOR operation that is irrepresentable by CIRQ.

# As a final note, consider how difficult it would be to represent this circuit in Cirq. In particular, there is a for loop, where inside the for loop there is an algebraic operation (XOR) that feeds forward onto a variable (parity). This circuit is inexpressible in Cirq without some serious hacking of ancilla qubit registers.
