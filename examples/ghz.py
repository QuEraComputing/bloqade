# A simple GHZ state preparation circuit can be done with N CX gates and 1 H gate.
# This gives circuit execution depth of N+1.

# > log depth impl of ghz state prep
# Let's take a look how we can rewrite the circuit toward more QuEra's hardware friendly circuit.
# We can rewrite the GHZ state preparation circuit with log(N) depth by rearranging the CX gates
# [citation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08946 â€“ Mooney, White, Hill, Hollenberg)


# Note it is important to separate the concept of circuit depth and circuit execution depth.
# For example, in the following implementation, each CX gate instruction inside the for loop are executed in sequence.
# So even thought the circuit depth is N/2 + 1. The circuit execution depth is still N + 1.

# > native gate set and parallelism
# On our digital quantum computer, by nature can execute native gate in parallel in an single instruction/ execution cycle.
# The concept is very similar to the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) in classical computing.
# On our hardware, there are two important factor to be consider:
# 1. the native gate set is arbitrary (parallel) rotations and (parallel) CZ gates.
# 2. Our atom shuttling architecture allows arbitrary qubit connectivity. This means that our parallel instruction is not limited to certain hardware connectivity (for example nearest neighbor connectivity).
#
# Let's try to rewrite the `layer` subroutinme.
# We know that the CX gate can be decomposed into CZ gate with two single qubit gates Ry(-pi/2) and Ry(pi/2) acting on the target qubits.
# After such decomposition, we can now using our parallel gate instructions `parallel.u` and `parallel.cz`.
# With the following modification, we can further reduce the circuit execution depth to n (log of total qubit number N)

# Note on using closure to capture global variable:
# Since qasm2 does not allow main program with arguments, so we need to put the program in a closure.
# our kirin compiler toolchain can capture the global variable inside the closure.
# In this case, the n_qubits will be captured upon calling the `ghz_half_simd(n_qubits)` python function,
# As a result, the return qasm2 program will not have any arguments.
